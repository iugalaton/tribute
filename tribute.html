            1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how foon, doubling wheat yields
            1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
            that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
            mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
            1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize

            1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
            2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
            are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
            dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
            called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
            2009 - dies at the age of 95.
            "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering
            intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

            -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
